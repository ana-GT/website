Summary
=======
This paper presents a fundamental classification of prehensile hand movement in 2 types: *precision grip* and *power grip*.

Grip classification
===================
Loosely, hand movements can be divided in 2 big groups:

1. *Prehensile movements:* In which an object is seized and held partly or wholly within the compass of the hand
2. *Non-prehensile movement:* Movement in which no grasping or seizing ins involved buy by which objects can be manipulated by pushing or lifting motions of the hand as a whole or of the digits individually.

The proposed classification of power and precision grip only refers to *prehensile movements*:

1. *Power grip*
   In which the object is held in a clamp formed by the partly flexed fingers and the palm. The thumb (normally lying in the plane of the palm) applies pressure to secure the grip.

2. *Precision grip*
   In this grip, the object is pinched between the flexor aspects of the finger and the opposuing thumb.

Factors affecting hand configuration
====================================

1. *Shape of the object:* Affects at some extent, but it is not as determinant as some might think. Check out the example below (image from the original paper):

      Left: Power grip used when starting to open the lid. Right: Precision grip used once the lid is loose. Both types of grasp are used for the same shaped object.

2. *Size of the object*
3. *Miscellaneous factors:* Physical factors related to the object being grasped, such as weight, texture, temperature, etc. Also, other factors related to the person performing the grasp might affect the grasp performance.
4. *Type of activity:* It seems clear that the nature of the intended activity is the final (if not the most important) deciding factor for the selection of the grip pattern to use.

Anatomical features of power and precision grip
===============================================

To differentiate finger configurations for both types of grip, we will make a difference between the thumb and the rest of fingers.

1. Posture of the thumb: In power grip it is generally adducted (getting as close as possible to the palm to produce a good clamp). In precision grips, the thumb joints are generally abducted (opposing to the other fingers, forming a kind-of jaw in a clamp)

2. Other features as the posture of the hand on the forearm, the hook grip and combined grip are briefly discussed in the paper as well, but they are not very relevant to our purposes.
